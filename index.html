                    It's a slow day at Tim's house. Tim has been in his room board all day.
                    He is laying on his bed waiting for something fun to come along. Rufus, 
                    Tim's dog, slowly walked into Tim's room carying a stick. Tim look at his Rufus
                    then he looked at the stick and he smiled and said "come on Rufus, we are going on
                    a journey!"
